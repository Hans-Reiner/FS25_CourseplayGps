# FS25_CourseplayGps
Courseplay GPS Extension
-
This is a Mod for for Farming Simulator 25 allowing to use GPS tracking (automatic steering) based on Courseplay courses. In order to use this mod there is the need to have Courseplay (https://github.com/Courseplay/Courseplay_FS25) installed. 

Afterwards you can use Field courses to enable GPS tracking when driving the tractors or harvesters. The motivation was to have the chance to smoothly swap between the CP helper and manual driving, but still using GPS tracking. The Giants automatic steering does come with own courses causing an offset. In general does the CP course generator offer much more options to control the details of courses incl. the option to load and save them. An example is cutting the grass (10m working width) and afterwards picking it up by simply loading the same course.


How to use this mod:
- 
- Generate or load a CP course
- You'll need to activate the CP helper for a short moment (1 second is enough).
- As from this moment the you can activate the automatic steering (please assign an activate key in the settings)
- The system picks the closest way points and start to steer automatically

Features:
-
- Automatically follows the CP course
- At the end of each row is the GPS tracking disabled
- At the end of each row is the cruise control switched off 
- When a CP course is loaded the Giants automatic steering course is being removed. This allows to use the same key binding and prevents 2 auto-steering systems are becoming activated. 

Known / open issues:
-
- The mod was only tested in single player. In case somebody would like to use MP and would like to test the functionallity, please contact me.
- The system is foreseen for working on fields only.
- In the moment you'd like to use the Giants auto-steering feature, you'll need to remove the CP course from the vehicle. Not the best solution, but for me this works for the moment. Suggestions are very welcome :-).
